# Examples

This directory demonstrates the different stages of the assembler pipeline.

## valid/
Contains valid assembly programs and the files generated by the assembler:
- `.as` – original assembly source
- `.am` – preprocessed file after macro expansion and comment removal
- `.ob` – final machine code output
- `.ent` / `.ext` – entry and external symbol tables (when applicable)

## macros/
Examples focusing on the preprocessing stage and macro expansion.

## errors/
Assembly files demonstrating syntax and semantic error detection.
These files do not produce output files and are used to showcase error handling.
